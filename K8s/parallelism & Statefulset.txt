    type: RollingUpdate

In Kubernetes Deployments, there are two different types of strategies available: RollingUpdate and Recreate.

RollingUpdate: This is the default strategy. It updates the pods gradually in a rolling fashion, 
ensuring that at least a certain number (maxUnavailable) of pods are available during the update process. 
It also allows a certain number of additional pods (maxSurge) to be created beyond the desired number of pods, 
facilitating parallelism during updates.

Recreate: This strategy terminates all existing pods before creating new ones. 
It's a simpler strategy compared to RollingUpdate, but it may cause downtime during updates since all pods are terminated before the new ones are created. 
This strategy is useful in cases where downtime is acceptable or where parallelism is not a concern.
